## App scaffolding
The provided directory structure appears to be relatively well-organized for a React.js application. But here are some suggestions for maintainability and scalability:
- Separation of components into subdirectoreis is good practice, but we have to take into account all these components have to have styling files (like .css, .scss, .less), tests and any other related files, it is important to located all these files into related subdirectories or in the same directory: Filters: Filters.tsx, Filters.types.tsx, Filters.css and etc.
- Also we can separate layout into Header, Navbar and Footer, it will be useful if there are any other designs for authenticated and guest users
- Locating pages in 'pages' folder can be good practice for maintaining
- API request functions must be located in separate folder it may be 'services'
- Recommended folder structure: .
  ```└── Root Folder/
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── audios
  │   ├── icons
  │   ├── images
  │   └── videos
  ├── components/
  │   ├── Filters/
  │   │   ├── Filters.tsx
  │   │   ├── Filters.types.tsx
  │   │   └── Filters.css
  │   └── Products/
  │       ├── Products.tsx
  │       ├── Products.types.tsx
  │       └── Products.css
  ├── layout/

  │   │   ├── Header.tsx
  │   │   └── Header.css

  │       ├── Footer.tsx
  │       └── Footer.css
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── Home/

  │   │   └── Home.css
  │   └── Login/
  │       ├── Login.tsx
  │       └── Login.css
  ├── utils/
  │   ├── constants/
  │   │   └── Firebas.ts
  │   └── helpers/
  │       ├── arrays.ts
  │       └── helpers.ts
  └── services/
  ├── api.ts
  └── dataUtils.ts```

## Code review
### Code Quality Issues:
- It seems Tailwind CSS classes used for rapid styling, but it is a good practice extract common styles to separate files, using "BEM" naming convention or any other with block and modifier structure, which is more maintainbale in the future. Using CSS preprocessor like .scss or .less which are widely used by developers, may be better coding and styling experience. In the future anybody can maintain and make scale in code base.
- Naming is one of the most important things in project, and in some case used names could be more descriptive. For example, instead of 'myBrands' we can use 'brands', 'selectedBrands'.
- Error handling can be more logical. For example instead of logging occured error in console, consider to display user-friendly error message. In this case developer can make his/her own ui styles or can use 3rd party library like, toastr, alertpal and etc. Also developer can catch network errors and display related error messages to users. (For exmaple in 'getProducts' funciton).
- It seems all data requested from dummy json api. In this case it will be good practice to show simple loader while user waits data to shown.
- In some files inline assets used like SVG's. Developer has to separate assets into assets directory, may be into icons folter under assets directory in structure mentioned above. In this situation maintainablity goes down while to find out something and fix it.

### Optimization Opportunities
- Avoid to use hard coded string in application. If we decide to move multilingual application, it will take a lot of time to handle all strings in application. Instead of hard coding, we can use 3rd party libraries like i18n to show related string to users.
